# Twitter Score
This is a web app project written for CS 411 at Boston University by Adam Streich, Zachary Hyman, Sean Chun, and Taylor Farheen.

## Overview
The app is made using a model view controller architecture and incorporates third party OAuth through twitter and a MongoDB database.
When a user logs in with twitter and a score is calculated based on their 100 most recent tweets. Then based on that score a random fact is returned which deals with the number. (I.E. if your score is 12 the fact may be "A dozen has 12 eggs.")
