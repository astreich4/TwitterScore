### Primary Story 5 - User Friend Score Lookup ###

As a user, I would like to access the score of my friends who have used the site and look up a specific friend in that list.

### Description ###

The User once logged in and linking account to social medias will have access to the friend tab on the dashboard, see log in
and link account primary stories. The dashboard will feature a friend panel displaying a few top public scores of friends,
pulled from social medias, who have also used the site to generate a score. Upon clicking on the friend tab the User will be
directed to the friend directory page listing the scores of all friends in the database found with public scores, see privacy
secondary story for detail. The User will then have the option to click on a friend which would display some more detailed
information from their profile, or scroll through the list of all friends. The User will also have access to a search bar at
the top of the page which will search and sort friends using their names.
