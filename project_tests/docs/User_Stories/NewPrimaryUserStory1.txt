### New Primary User Story 1 ###

As a logged in user, I am on the homepage and want to have my score and fact displayed.

### Description ###

In the center of the page will be a "Calculate" button. Once the user clicks this button there will be a call to the Twitter API to receive a JSON back of the users last 100 tweets. That will then be parsed and a score computed. The score will then be sent to the fact API and a fact returned. The fact and the score will be displayed once computed on the page to the user above the "Calculate" button.

Happy Path
1. User hits button
2. Twitter successfully retrieves 100 tweets
3. Numbers API successfully returns fact
4. Content is displayed on screen

Things that could go wrong:
Twitter is unable to get 100 tweets.
	1. If the issue is the user has less than 100 tweets, the app will continue to run as normal, but just with less data.
	2. If the user has no Tweets then instead of a score and fact being displayed an error message will be displayed.
Fact API does not return a fact.
	1. An error message saying no fact was found and the correctly computed score will be shown.
