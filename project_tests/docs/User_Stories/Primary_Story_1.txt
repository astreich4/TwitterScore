### Primary Story 1 - User Account Login/Creation ###

As a user, I have visited this site and would like to create a new account or login to an existing account to access 
the primary dashboard of the site.

### Description ###

Upon accessing the web app page the User is presented with a Google login prompt with fields for Username and Password as
well as two buttons, to log in with an existing account, or to create a new account. Once entering in the correct username
and password for their Google account they would hit the "log in" button and is then redirected to the dashboard page. The
dashboard page will open and consist of 3 main panels; Friends, Profile, and University. 

If the User enters a valid Google profile and tries to log in before having created an account, the page will prompt the 
user that no local profile exists for that google account and ask them instead to create a profile.
