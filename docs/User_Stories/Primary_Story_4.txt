### Primary Story 4 - User Update Fact and Score ###

As a logged in user, after receiving my score and fact I would like to recieve another one, perhaps my score has changed.

### Description ###

After the User has recieved their score and fact, they will be presented with two bottons in the upper left corner of
the application, the Home and Sign Out buttons. If the User selects the Home button they will be directed to the greeting 
page where they will be able to push the Find Fact button again. This will go to the Twitter API and retrieve a score 
and produce a new fact with the score generated. Each time the User prompts for a new fact the Twitter API is pinged again 
to always have the most up to date score.
