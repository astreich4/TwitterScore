Based on the app we are trying to build and previous experience of the team, our group has decided to go with a Flask Python
server with an Angular front end app. We believe that this architecture is the correct choice for multiple reasons. We plan
on using Angular for our front end web application so that information may be exchanged or updated without the need for page
refreshes. Angular will also allow more freedom in the interactivity and design of the front end application. In the decision
to chose a Flask backend, we took into consideration the skill level and familiarity of languages to each of our team members
and decided a Python web server would be the best option. Our secondary canidate for a backend architecture was utilizing Node,
however, not all members of our team are fully familiar with javascript, and as a result would rather work in Python, a language 
most are very familiar with. Despite most members of the group having a fairly thorough understanding of Python however, none 
have used a Flask web server before, and so hosting a web application is new territory for all members of the group.
