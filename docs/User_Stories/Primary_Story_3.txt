### Primary Story 3 - User Dashboard Interactions ###

As a user, I have already signed in with an account but have left the web page but continue to remain in the same session and
navigate back to the home page.

### Description ###

Upon returning to the dashboard after logging in to our page through Twitter authentication, as long as the User continues 
to have the cookie placed by our web app in their session, they will be seen as a logged in User and greeted again. When 
the User is authenticated the User's Twitter username and a secret placed in the cookie is also stored in our backend 
database which verifies that the user is logged in when accessing the dashboard of the web application. The User is 
checked for logged in credentials each time the Home page is visited
