### Primary Story 3 - User Dashboard Interactions ###

As a user, I have already created an account and have linked social medias. I would like to see my generated media 
scoring as well as scores of my friends and popular universities.

### Description ###

Upon returning to the dashboard after creating and linking social media accounts to site account, see previous stories, 
the User will be presented with the Dashboard. The Dashboard will consist of three panels labeled Friends, Profile, and
Universities. The User's score will be presented in large numbers in the center of the Profile tab in the middle of the
screen. Scrolling down from the score, additional statistics and badges may be provided underneath the large overall score.
The leftmost panel on the page will be a friends panel. The user will see names and scores of friends who have made accounts
in the web page ranked. Friends will be pulled from the Users associated social media. The rightmost panel will show the
scores of top ranking Universities if the User is unassociated, or show the ranking of the User's university depending on
whether they have joined one or not. Each side panel will have a button redirecting to that panels additional information
page. The center panel will have a button at the bottom to access User preferences and account information.
