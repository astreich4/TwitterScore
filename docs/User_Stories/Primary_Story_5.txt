### Primary Story 5 - User Log Out ###

As a user, I would like to log out of this Web Application.

### Description ###

Once on the Score and Fact page, after the User has recieved information pulled from our APIs they will have a choice to Sign
Out using a botton in the top left corner of the application. This button is also featured on the Home page/Greeting page 
where the User pressed a button to recieve their score. Whenever a User is logged in they may only access pages where this 
button is present. Upon hitting the log out button the User is kicked back to the initial login screen an all cookies of their
login are removed from the database using the associated username as a lookup. Any User will then need to log in again to 
access features of the app
