### Primary Story 2 - User Click to access score ###

As a logged in user with an existing Twitter profile, I want to find the score and fact associated with the results pulled from my Twitter timeline

### Description ###

The user will be prompted from the dashboard in the center profile window by a box saying "Click here for your score!" 
and then after clicking the redirect button  will be sent to a page where they can view the score returned from analyzing
the Twitter timeline as well as a score underneath. If the APIs are unable to pull a Twitter timeline or score a 
message reading that no score or fact can be found will be displayed.
