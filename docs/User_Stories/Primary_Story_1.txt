### Primary Story 1 - User Account Login ###

As a user, I have visited this site and would like to  login to an existing Twitter account to access 
the primary features of the site.

### Description ###

Upon accessing the web app page the User is presented with a welcome message and a button redirect to login with a
Twitter account. When clicking the button the user will be redirected to Twitter's approved developer app login page 
where they can either indicate that they would like to approve the app if already logged in, or be asked to login to
Twitter. The User will then be redirected back to the home page of our web app with a welcome message addressing the
username featured in the used Twitter login.

If the User does not enter a valad Twitter username they will remain on Twitter's login page until valad credentials are
entered. If the User travels back to the web app they will be presented with the same redirect shown previously until 
they successfully login.
