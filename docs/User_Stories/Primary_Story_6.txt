### Primary Story 6 - User Access University Scores ###

As a logged in user, from the dashboard I would like to access the score of all universities on the site as 
well as join a university which I have not yet done so.

### Description ###

In the Dashboard panel for the University section there will be an "Expand" button at the bottom. When clicked this will bring
the user to a page containing either a map or a list (implementation not decided on yet) of University rankings. Additionally
there will be a field where you can type in a University to "join" them. There will also be a button that when pressed will
return the user to the dashboard.
