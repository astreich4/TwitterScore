Project Pitches:

Our main idea is to create a web app that is an interactive and competitive social media ranking system. 
We think that an app which can interweave friendly competition into social media will definately peak the interests of many.
Our web app will generate user scores based on provided social media accounts, and give the user oppertunity to see scores 
of friends who have also used the service. The Web app will aslo feature the oppertunity for a user to add their individual 
score to benefit a larger group such as a university. We hope to use this user generated ranking and potentially other factors 
such as academics, sport teams, active influencers, etc to build Univserity rankings as well. Universities will have opportunities 
to earn badges and increase their rankings based off of the number of users each school has, as well as the qualifications that 
each user brings to support their college. We believe this will have a high expansion rate and will spark positive competition
amongst college aged students. This could easily have roots in Boston, having many surrounding colleges and 
universities to kickstart our idea.

Our secondary idea is to consolidate all of the trending topics from different social media apps or news 
outlets into one easily accessible web app. Instead of having to go to twitter to see trending topics, 
exit out, open up instagram, type in a hashtag for the same topic- our app will get rid of this inefficiency 
and make it much easier for a user to search for a topic and pull all of the related social media news. 
This differs from other search engines in that we seek to pull trending topics and provide quick access 
to hashtags or topics from social media in particular i.e. twitter, instagram, snapchat news, youtube, etc. 
We believe there is nothing with this level of accessibility and efficiency on the market yet.
